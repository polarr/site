		I have a lot of experience with Fullstack Web Developmentâ€”from frontend, UI and many rendering
		patterns, to APIs, servers and infrastructure, auth, cms, many DB paradigms, production architecture design

		Other than that, I sometimes like to render cool shaders with OpenGL. I can implement common
		rasterization, raytracing and raymarching algorithms as well as shadows and ambient occlusion,
		but there's still a lot for me to learn. I've also done some game development with p5.js and
		pygame in the past, and I plan to pick game dev back up soon.
