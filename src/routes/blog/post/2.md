This is just some introductory exposure to Graph Theory on some notes I took. For Part 2, see [here](/blog/post/3).

Graph Theory, as the name suggests, is the study of *graphs*. But what exactly is a graph?

> ### Definition
> A simple graph $G$ consists of a vertex set (not necessarily finite) $V$ and a finite edge set $E$ consisting of doubletons of $V$. 

This is a *simple* graph. The figure above shows a visualization of six vertices (also called nodes), connected by seven edges. A graph is simple if and only if it does not have more than one edge between any two vertices and no edge starts and ends at the same vertex. 

We can extend simple graphs to allow more variety, such as multigraphs (nodes are allowed to be connected by multiple edges), pseudographs (self-connecting loops are also allowed), and hypergraphs (one edge can connect multiple nodes). **Unless otherwise stated, assume any graphs are simple by convention in what follows.**

Often, we also assign properties to vertices and edges. For example, in a *directed* graph, edges point specifically from one vertex to another. Edges and nodes might also have a weight, color, etc, assigned to them. Then we can optimize some function of these parameters in a subgraph satisfying some properties.

## Applications of Graph Theory

It is relatively easy to see that graphs serve as good models for networks, and *networks* are interesting long before the advent of computers. One of the oldest problems in this theory goes back to Euler.

    The Konisberg Bridge Problem

    Can one start on one of the islands, cross each bridge exactly once, and end back on the original island?
</Blockquote>

![The Konisberg Bridges](https://cdn.britannica.com/77/74877-050-F5DD4C34/Leonhard-Euler-route-each-question-bridges-Swiss.jpg)

Of course, we can model each island as a node and bridges as edges between the nodes. In fact, here we have a multigraph that is not simple. 

This question was famously answered in the negative by Leonhard Euler. His solution to the problem laid the foundations for Graph Theory and [conceptually, Topology](https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/2036039). To this day, the two fields remain closely connected, despite being studied by disparate groups of mathematicians.

### Planar graphs
The above image might inspire one to wonder: *Are all graphs expressable as a 2-dimensional drawing?*

Certainly one can project any graph onto the plane with no regard for structure, but mathematicians are interested in a more sophisticated question: *Are all graphs expressable as a 2-dimensional drawing such that no edges intersect?*

The answer is actually *no*, and graphs that do satisfy this property are called *planar*.

See [*Kuratowski's Theorem*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kuratowski%27s_theorem) for related info on the characterization of planar graphs.

### Four Color Theorem
Many people are probably familiar with the *Four Color Theorem*, given it's popularity with pop-science. The (layman) statement is quite simple, all 'maps' can be colored with four colors such that no two boundaries that share an edge are monochromatic. However, the proof and underlying mathematical reasonings are far from simple.
- The Six color theorem could be proven with half a page, and is a common exercise for a first year Graph Theory course.
- Five color theorem: Substantially harder, perhaps suitable as a research assignment.
- Four color theorem: Very difficult, and we still don't have a pure pen and paper proof. A very large finite amount of cases were checked computationally.

### Graph Isomorphism
Here's a problem of high modern significance:

<Blockquote border bg class="p-4 my-4">
    Graph Isomorphism Problem

    Can you rearrange vertices without changing edge pairs to morph one graph into another? 
</Blockquote>

It turns out solving this problem is quite difficult, and so far mathematicians have only been able to produce an algorithm in *Quasi-polynomial* time complexity. This problem has surged in popularity due to its relevance with *P vs NP*; A polynomial algorithm or lack thereof is relatively within reach and would contribute substantial progress towards the famous unsolved computer science problem.

## Traversal

### Paths, Walks, and Cycles
Let $G = (V, E)$ be a simple graph. A *walk* is defined as a sequence of vertices $\{P\}_{i = 1}^{k}$ of vertices $p_i \in V$, where $p_i, p_{i + 1}$ are connected by an edge $e \in E$ for all $i \in [1, k - 1]$. One could "walk" along these vertices consecutively and in order.

A *path* is a walk where $P$ contains no duplicate elements; $p_i$ are pairwise distinct. 

A *cycle* is a sequence $\{Q\}_{i = 1}^{k}$ such that $\{Q\}_{i = 1}^{k - 1}$ is a path and $q_k = q_1$.

### Connectivity

A simple graph $G = (V, E)$ is *connected* if for any two vertices $v, w \in V$, there exists a path connecting $v$ and $w$.

A *connected component* is a subgraph $g \in G$ such that $g$ is connected. In most cases, we can assume the graph we are working with is connected, as each connected component in an unconnected graph can usually be treated seperately.

### Travelling Salesman

In the Konisberg Bridge Problem, we were asked, *Can we traverse all the edges exactly once, and return to our starting node?*

In most cases, however, we are more concerned with 

> Can we traverse all the nodes exactly once, and returning to our starting node?

Such a traversal is called a *Hamiltonian Cycle*. A graph that has such a cycle is considered *Hamiltonian*.

<Blockquote border bg class="p-4 my-4">
    Exercise (Dirac's Theorem):

    If every vertex $v$ in a simple graph $G$ satsifies [$\deg{v}$](#degree) $\geq \vert V \vert / 2$, $G$ is Hamiltonian.
</Blockquote>

Of practical signficance is the widely-studied **Travelling Salesman Problem**, where we further assign a cost to each edge. Now this into an optimization problem, where we not only consider whether or not it is possible to have a Hamiltonian Cycle, but to find the cycle with minimum cost.

To learn more about graph traversal, commonly appearing in informatics competitions, see the [USACO Silver Guide](https://usaco.guide/silver/graph-traversal) and [Gold Guide](https://usaco.guide/gold/unweighted-shortest-paths).

## Density

A basic result concerning connected graphs is the following: $\vert E \vert \geq \vert V \vert - 1$.
The theorem is sharp in the sense that equality is achieveable, in the form of *Trees*.

*If a graph is "too sparse", it can't be connected.*

![A tree with 6 vertices and 5 edges](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/24/Tree_graph.svg)

### Trees

A simple connected graph $G = (V, E)$ is said to be a *Tree* if any of the following are satisfied: 
- $\vert E \vert = \vert V \vert - 1$
- $G$ has no cycles.
- For each pair of distinct vertices $v, w$ there is a unique path starting at $v$ and ending at $w$.

    Exercise:

    Prove that the three above definitions are equivalent.
</Blockquote>

<!--
<Blockquote border bg class="p-4 my-4">
    Solution: 

    To see the equivalence of the former two definitions, note that if $G$ has a cycle of length $k$, there must be at least $k$ edges in the cycle. Furthermore, there should be at least $\vert V \vert - k$ additional edges to satisfy connectivity. On the other hand, if $\vert E \vert \geq \vert V \vert$, consider the smallest subgraph on $k$ vertices with at least $k$ edges.

    Now we tackle the equivalence of the latter two definitions. Note if $G$ has a cycle $(p_1, p_2, \cdots, p_k, p_1)$, then there is not a unique path from $p_1$ to $p_k$; Starting at $p_1$ we can directly travel to $p_k$ or take the path $(p_1, p_2, \cdots, p_k)$. For the other direction, if there is not a unique path from say $a_0 = b_0$ to $a_x = b_x$, we consider any two distinct paths $(a_0, a_1, a_2, \cdots, a_x)$ and $(b_0, b_1, b_2, \cdots, b_x)$. Let $k$ be the first index such $a_k \not = b_k$ and $m > k$ the first index such $a_m = b_n$ for some $n > k$. It's easy to see these both must exist. Then we have a cycle $(a_{k - 1}, a_k, \cdots, a_m = b_n, b_{n - 1}, \cdots b_{k - 1})$.

On the other end of the spectrum, we have **complete graphs**, where there is an edge betwen every node. This the densest possible simple graph. These two special types of graphs are immensely useful.

<a name="degree" />

## Degrees and Neighborhoods

An *adjacent* vertex of $v \in V$, is a vertex connected to $v$ by an edge.
The *degree* of a vertex $v$, denoted $\deg{v}$, is the number of adjacent vertices of $v$. The *neighbourhood* of $v$ is the subgraph of $G$ composed of all vertices adjacent to $v$ (does not include $v$ itself) and all edges connecting those vertices.

If we have a directed graph, we can be more specific with degrees. The *outdegree*, denoted $\deg^+{v}$, is the number of adjacent vertices $w$ with an edge pointing from $v$ to $w$. Analogously, the *indegree* ($\deg^-{v}$) is the number of adjacent vertices $w$ with an edge pointing from $w$ to $v$.

### Handshaking Lemma
For a finite undirected graph $G = (V, E)$,

$$
\sum_{v \in V} \deg{v} = 2\vert E \vert
$$

Take a moment to convince yourself the lemma is true.

<Blockquote border bg class="p-4 my-4">
    Exercise: 

    In a finite undirected graph, prove that the number of vertices that have odd degree is even.
</Blockquote>

We also have the following two identities:

In a directed graph,
$$
\sum_{v \in V} \deg^+{v} = \sum_{v \in V} \deg^-{v} = \vert E \vert
$$

In a **tournament**, a complete directed graph,
$$
    \sum_{v \in V} (\deg^+{v})^2 = \sum_{v \in V} (\deg^-{v})^2
$$
