This is just some introductory exposure to Graph Theory on some notes I took. For Part 1, see [here](/blog/post/2). **Same as in Part 1: unless otherwise stated, assume any graphs are simple by convention in what follows.**

## The Complete Graph

<Img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/9e/Complete_graph_K7.svg" alt="The complete graph on 7 vertices" class="max-w-sm" />

The complete graph with $n$ vertices, denoted as $K_n$, is a simple connected graph such that there is an edge between any two vertices. The complete graph is analogous to the *symmetric group* of group theory, in that it serves as a "mother of all graphs". In other words, **every** finite simple graph can be realized as the subgraph of a complete graph. More precisely, every finite simple graph can be obtained from a complete graph by keeping the same vertex set and removing some edges from the edge set.

    Exercise:

    How many edges does $K_n$ have? How many subgraphs with $n$ vertices?

### Extremal Graph Theory

Complete graphs are also one of the central objects studied in extremal graph theory, which asks: *What is the largest/smallest graph with some kind of property?* Some significant results have come from studying graphs with no complete subgraph.

<Blockquote border bg class="p-4 my-4">
    Mantel's Theorem:

    The maximum number of edges in a graph on $n$ vertices that does not have a subgraph $K_3$ is $\lfloor n^{2}/4 \rfloor$.
</Blockquote>

You can try proving this with induction, noting the equality case of a *complete bipartite graph*, a bipartite graph $V = A \cup B$ with an edge connecting every pair of vertices $(a \in A, b \in B)$. [Turan's Theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tur%C3%A1n%27s_theorem) generalizes this result.

### Graph Colorings

Complete graphs serve as the perfect setting to discuss **graph colorings**, which form a very popular class of contest problems. A vertex/edge coloring is an assignment for some finite set of colors $\mathcal{C}$, where it assigns each vertex/edge a color.

Size of the color set determines the *order* of the coloring. 

We say that a graph $G = (V, E)$ is *$k$-colorable* if one can color the vertices of $G$ using at most $k$ colors so that there are no monochromatic edges: that is, for each edge $e \in E$ the two endpoints of $e$ have distinct colors.

The chromatic number of $G$ is the least integer $k$ such that $G$ is *$k$-colorable*.

### Colorability of the complete graph $K_n$.

The complete graph $K_n$ is $n$*-colorable* but not $(n - 1)$*-colorable*.

The proof is simple: It is obviously *$n$-colorable*, as we can color each vertex a different color. It is not however *$(n - 1)$-colorable* as by the pigeonhole principle 2 vertices must share a color, but they must also be connected by an edge by definition. 

<Blockquote border bg class="p-4 my-4">
    Exercise:

    Prove the converse. That is, if a simple graph on $n$ vertices is not $(n - 1)$-colorable, it is $K_n$.

## Planar Graph Colorings

![The planar map graph of a map](https://i.stack.imgur.com/yMPAD.png)

There's an intuitive notion that graph colorings and topology should be intimately connected. This is motivated by the Map Coloring problem, posed by South African mathematician William Gilmour Guthrie in 1872. The problem arises exactly as the name suggests: when coloring a map (Guthrie was trying to color a map of England), how many colors must be available to guaratee that no two contiguous regions share the same color? 

You probably already know the answer.

    The Four Color Theorem, again

    We are now in a position to restate this theorem with more sophisticated language: *All planar graphs are 4-colorable.*
</Blockquote>

In planar graphs, we also have the notion of *faces*, the regions of space bounded by edges. Faces can be unbounded. Note that they are not the same as regions in maps, which are actually expressed as nodes in planar graphs.

<Blockquote border bg class="p-4 my-4">
    Exercise (Face-Shaking Lemma):

    Consider a connected planar graph $G = (V, E, F)$. For a face $f \in F$ let $\alpha(f)$ be the number of edges enclosing $f$. Then
    
    $$
        \sum_{f \in F} \alpha(f) = 2 |E|
    $$
</Blockquote>

<Blockquote border bg class="p-4 my-4">
    Exercise:

    Prove that for a connected planar graph $G = (V, E, F)$, that 
    $$
        |E| \leq 3 |V| - 6
    $$
</Blockquote>

We also have the powerful *Euler's Formula*.

<Blockquote border bg class="p-4 my-4">
    Euler's Formula:

    In a connected planar graph,

    $$
        |V| - |E| + |F| = 2
    $$
</Blockquote>

Consider $n$ lines in the plane, no two parallel and no three concurrent. Convince yourself of Euler's Formula. You might find that $|V| - |E| + |F| = 1$. In this context, we can imagine the unbounded line segments converge at an extra vertex at infinity.

<Blockquote border bg class="p-4 my-4">
    Exercise:

    Suppose $G = (V, E, F)$ is a connected planar graph with a cycle. The length of the smallest cycle is called the graph's **girth**, $g$. Prove,

    $$
        |E| \leq \frac{g}{g - 2} (|V| - 2)
    $$

## Bipartite Graphs
A bipartite graph is a graph that is *2-colorable*. 

<Blockquote border bg class="p-4 my-4">
    Exercise:

    A simple finite graph $G = (V, E)$ is bipartite if and only if there exists no odd cycles.
</Blockquote>

<Blockquote border bg class="p-4 my-4">
    Solution:

     A cycle $C_k$ is bipartite if and only if $k$ is even (Why?). Thus there are no odd cycles if $G$ and thus any $C_k$ is bipartite.
    
    Now we tackle the harder direction: If $G$ is not bipartite then there must exist an odd cycle. Consider connected components $C = (P \in V, Q \in E) \in G$ seperately. Take any vertex $v$ in $P$, assign it a color, and alternate colors assignments by depth. For $C$ to not be bipartite, there must exist adjacent vertices $a_0, b_0 \in P$ that are monochromatic. Since $C$ was colored by depth, $a_0$ cannot be colored directly from $b_0$. Hence it must be colored from some $a_1 \in P$, and similarly $b_0$ must be colored from some $b_1 \in P$. If $a_1 = b_1$ then we are done, otherwise continue to $a_2, b_2$ and so on. Since $G$ and thus $C$ is finite, there must exist $n$ such that $a_n = b_n$. The cycle $(a_0, a_1, \cdots, a_{n - 1}, a_n = b_n, b_{n - 1}, b_{n - 2}, \cdots b_0, a_0)$ is odd and we are done.
</Blockquote>

Bipartite graphs are extremely applicable in the real world, because they model a lot of *natural assignment problems*. One of the basic questions that can be modelled by bipartite graphs is the following: Suppose at a worksite there are $m$ workers and $n$ different types of tasks that need to be completed (the tasks could involve electrical work, carpentry, transporting, etc.). For each worker $w$ there are certain tasks they can do, but they can only do one task at a time. How would one assign tasks to the workers as to minimal idling (i.e., as many workers should be working as possible) and no overlaps (i.e, each task should be done by at most one worker)?

We can restate this in graph theory. A **vertex cover** in a graph is a set of vertices that includes at least one endpoint of every edge, and a vertex cover is minimum if no other vertex cover has fewer vertices. A **matching** in a graph is a set of edges no two of which share an endpoint, and a matching is maximum if no other matching has more edges. So, in the general example above: *Given a bipartite graph, what is the optimal matching satisfying some conditions?*

As one can imagine, above question is analogous to many other applications, like assigning workers to employers, or applicants to colleges. Given their practical significance, there is a lot of interest in finding matchings which are somewhat optimal.

<Blockquote border bg class="p-4 my-4">
    Konig's Theorem:

    In a bipartite graph, the number of edges in a maximal matching is equal to the number of vertices in a minimal vertex cover.
</Blockquote>

Although interesting, the notion of vertex covers is hardly every relevant in math olympiads due to its relative obscurity and counter-intuitive definition.

## Hall's Marriage Theorem

Hall's Marriage Theorem characterizes the existance of perfect matchings. It is also a powerful tool in olympiads.

### Perfect Matching

![The blue lines are a perfect matching](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a7/Halls_theorem_matching_graph_theory2.svg)

Let $G = (V, E)$ be a bipartition $V = A \cup B$ (where $A$, $B$ denotes the 2 partitions). A *perfect $A$-matching* is a matching such that every vertex in $A$ is matched to a vertex in $B$.

Note that a perfect $A$-matching exists only if $\vert A \vert \leq \vert B \vert$.

### Statement 

<Blockquote border bg class="p-4 my-4">
    Hall's Theorem:

    Let $G = (V, E)$ be a bipartition $V = A \cup B$. Define $N(W)$ as the neighborhood of of a subset of vertices $W$. Then $G$ has a perfect $A$-matching if and only if for every subset $W$ in $A$ we have

    $$
        \vert W \vert \leq \vert N(W) \vert
    $$
</Blockquote>

In other words, a perfect $A$-matching exists if and only if for every subset $W$ of $A$, $W$ has at least as many neighbours in $B$ as $\vert W \vert$.

## Bipartite Problems

Bipartitions, matchings, and Hall's Theorem are common in olympiad combinatorics. For questions applying Hall's, the difficulty is usually in formulating the question in a graph-theoretic way and finding the correct bipartition.

    Problem (2012 Putnam B3):

Over the course of the tournament, each team played every other team exactly once. Can one necessarily choose one winning team from each day without choosing any team more than once?

    Fix an integer $n \geq 2$. An $n\times n$ sieve is an $n\times n$ array with $n$ cells removed so that exactly one cell is removed from every row and every column. A stick is a $1\times k$ or $k\times 1$ array for any positive integer $k$. For any sieve $A$, let $m(A)$ be the minimal number of sticks required to partition $A$. Find all possible values of $m(A)$, as $A$ varies over all possible $n\times n$ sieves.

    Challenge (2019 Canada MO Q5):

    A 2-player game is played on $n \geq 3$ points, where no three points are collinear. Each move consists of selecting 2 of the points and drawing a new line segment connecting them. The first player to draw a line segment that creates an odd cycle loses. (An odd cycle must have all its vertices among the $n$ points from the start, so the vertices of the cycle cannot be the intersections of the lines drawn). Find all $n$ such that the player to move first wins.
