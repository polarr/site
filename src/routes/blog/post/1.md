## Solution

The key idea is to consider the *slowest* train $T$. Note that:

- All trains behind $T$ will at some point all merge into $T$. 
- All trains ahead of $T$ will never interact with $T$ or the trains behind it. So, they form their own system with the same conditions in the problem statement.

We can apply a recursion. Define $f(x)$ to be the probability that a train of length $x$ (consisting of $x$ train cars) is dangerous. Note $xf(x)$ is the expected value of train cars removed from this train; it's 0 if it's not dangerous but $x$ if it is.

We have
$$
\mathbb{E}(n) = \frac{1}{n}\sum_{i = 1}^{n} i f(i) + \mathbb{E}(n - i)
$$
Here we iterate over all $i$, the possible positions of the slowest train, and sum the expected value $i f(i) + \mathbb{E}(n - i)$ (a train of length $i$ and a new system with $n - i$ train cars) in each case, and finally take the average.

We simply the recursion by considering $\mathbb{E}(n + 1) - \mathbb{E}(n)$:

$$
\mathbb{E}(n + 1) - \mathbb{E}(n) = \frac{1}{n + 1}\sum_{i = 1}^{n + 1} i f(i) + \mathbb{E}(n + 1 - i) - \frac{1}{n}\sum_{i = 1}^{n} i f(i) + \mathbb{E}(n - i)
$$

Remove the weights,

$$
(n + 1)\mathbb{E}(n + 1) - n\mathbb{E}(n) = \sum_{i = 1}^{n + 1} i f(i) + \mathbb{E}(n + 1 - i) - \sum_{i = 1}^{n} i f(i) + \mathbb{E}(n - i)
$$

$$
\iff (n + 1)\mathbb{E}(n + 1) - n\mathbb{E}(n) = (n + 1)f(n + 1) + \mathbb{E}(n)
$$

$$
\iff \mathbb{E}(n + 1) = f(n + 1) + \mathbb{E}(n)
$$

$f(0) = 0$, hence 

$$
\mathbb{E}(n) = \sum_{i = 1}^{n} f(n)
$$

### Lemma
    $f(n) = \frac{F_{n + 2}}{2^n}$, where $F_i$ is the $i$-th Fibonnaci number.

    Note $f(n) = \frac{g(n)}{2^n}$, where $g(n)$ is the number of possible length $n$ dangerous trains. Consider the first train car. If it contains dynamite, the entire train is dangerous if and only if the rest (without the first train car) of the train is dangerous. If it doesn't contain dynamite, the next train car must contain dynamite, and then the rest of the train must be dangerous. $g(n) = g(n - 1) + g(n - 2)$, and $g(1) = 2$, $g(2) = 3$. Thus $g(n) = F_{n + 2}$. $\blacksquare$

It remains to determine 
$$
\mathbb{E}(n) = \sum_{i = 1}^{n} \frac{F_{n + 2}}{2^n}
$$

Note convergence. Now standard techniques will finish.

$$
\mathbb{E}(n) = \frac{1}{2} \sum_{i = 1}^{n} \frac{F_{n + 1}}{2^{n- 1}} + \frac{1}{4} \sum_{i = 1}^{n} \frac{F_{n}}{2^{n - 2}}
$$

$$
= \frac{1}{2} \sum_{i = 0}^{n - 1} \frac{F_{n + 2}}{2^{n}} + \frac{1}{4} \sum_{i = -1}^{n - 2} \frac{F_{n + 2}}{2^{n}}
$$

$$
\mathbb{E}(n) = \frac{1}{2} \left(\mathbb{E}(n) + \frac{F_2}{1} - \frac{F_{n + 2}}{2^n} \right) + \frac{1}{4} \left(\mathbb{E}(n) + \frac{F_2}{1} + 2F_1 - \frac{F_{n + 2}}{2^n} - \frac{F_{n + 1}}{2^{n - 1}} \right)
$$

Solving yields

$$
\mathbb{E}(n) = 5 - \frac{2F_{n + 3} + F_{n + 2}}{2^n}
$$

Then 

$$
\lim_{n \to \infty} \mathbb{E}(n) = \boxed{5}
$$

# Something Else

Here's a distance estimator for the Sierpenski Pyramid from [Syntopia](http://blog.hvidtfeldts.net/index.php/2011/08/distance-estimated-3d-fractals-iii-folding-space/).

```glsl
// In GLSL, theme is Github Dark 
float pyramidDE(float scale, float offset, int iterations, vec3 p){
    for (int n = 0; n < iterations; ++n) {
        if (p.x + p.y < 0.0){ 
            p.xy = - p.yx;
        } 
        if (p.x + p.z < 0.0){ 
            p.xz = - p.zx;
        } 
        if (p.y + p.z < 0.0){ 
            p.zy = - p.yz;
        } 
        p = p * scale - offset * (scale - 1.0);
    }

    return length(p) * pow(scale, float(-iterations));
}
```
